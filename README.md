# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java programming: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The code attempts to access an array element that does not exist, resulting in a runtime exception.  The solution shows how to correct the error by ensuring that loop indices stay within the valid array bounds.

## Bug

The `Bug.java` file contains code that incorrectly iterates over an array, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

## Solution

The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code that avoids the out-of-bounds access by correctly checking the loop condition.
